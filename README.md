# Power Window Control System
The project aims to implement a front passenger door window control system with both passenger and driver control panels. The implementation should include the use of FreeRTOS, limit switches to restrict the window motor's movement, and obstacle detection to prevent jamming. The highlighted areas in red on the provided figure represent the specific components of the car to be implemented.

# System Basic Features
1. Manual open/close function
When the power window switch is pushed or pulled
continuously, the window opens or closes until the switch
is released.
2. One touch auto open/close function
When the power window switch is pushed or pulled
shortly, the window fully opens or closes.
3. Window lock function
When the window lock switch is turned on, the opening and closing of
all windows except the driverâ€™s window is disabled.
4. Jam protection function
This function automatically stops the power window and moves it
downward about 0.5 second if foreign matter gets caught in the
window during one touch auto close operation.
